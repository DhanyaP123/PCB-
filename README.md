AC TO DC CONVERTOR 

An AC to DC converter, also called a rectifier, is an electronic device that converts alternating current (AC) — the kind of current supplied by your wall outlet — into direct current (DC), which is required by most electronic devices like:

Mobile phones

Laptops

LEDs

Microcontrollers

Power banks

Why is it needed?

AC voltage changes direction (polarity) constantly, while DC voltage flows in one direction only. Most electronic components (like chips, sensors, etc.) can only work with DC. So, the converter ensures the devices get the steady, one-way flow of electricity they need.

EXAMPLE 

If you use a mobile phone charger, it takes 230V AC from the wall and gives out something like 5V DC to charge your phone. That’s a real-world AC to DC converter.
